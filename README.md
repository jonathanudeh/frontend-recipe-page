- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid and flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Features

- Recipe page displays correctly
- Recipe page scales properly
- Recipe page looks and feels easy

### What-I-learned

This time around I didnt just use css grid. I combined flexbox which I'll say is my strength and grid which I am starting to love. I am building my strength in them both.

### Continued-development

I will be using more of css grid layout as well as flexbox so as to get really familiarized with them both even though my flexbox skills are a lot smoother than that of my grid.
